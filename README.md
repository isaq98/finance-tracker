# finance-tracker
Personal project building my own API using a Python/Flask backend and connecting it to a React frontend to use in order to track and organize my monthly finances

## Organization
The code is broken up into two simple directories - _flask-server_ being the backend and _frontend_ being the React frontend. Simple commands such as **flask run**
and **npm start** will spin up each respective portion of the project.

## Visual
Below is a very simple screenshot of what the dashboard looks like to display and add values to a sheet:
